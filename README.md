# Voter-Turnout-Prediciton
Project Overview

This project aims to predict voter turnout in elections using regression models. By analyzing historical election data and demographic, socioeconomic, and regional factors, we build predictive models to estimate voter participation rates accurately.

Objective

	•	Analyze key factors influencing voter turnout.
	•	Build and compare regression models to predict voter turnout.
	•	Evaluate model performance using standard metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²).
